# Wine-Quality-Prediction

## Overview

The Wine Quality Prediction project is a machine learning project that aims to predict the quality of wines based on several attributes. It utilizes a dataset of wine samples with various features, such as alcohol content, pH level, and more, to classify wines into categories of "good" or "not good" quality.

## Usage

- Load the Wine quality dataset.
- Preprocess and clean the data.
- Explore the dataset through visualizations.
- Prepare the data to train accordingly.
- Build and train the Logistic regresssion and Linear regression model.
- Evaluate the Model performance using accuracy,confusion matrix,mean squared error (MSE), and R-squared (R2) score.
- Adjust hyperparameters or try different algorithms for potential improvements.

# Conclusion
This project demonstrates the application of machine learning in predicting wine quality. By training on a dataset with various wine attributes, the models can classify wines as good or not good quality with a certain level of accuracy. The choice of model and parameter tuning can further enhance prediction performance.
